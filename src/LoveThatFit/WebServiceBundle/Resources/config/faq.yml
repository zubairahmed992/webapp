  question: Does the table height really matter when I take my picture?
  answer: SelfieStyler’s full height selfie is more than just a pretty picture. Our full height selfie process scans your unique silhouette into our database for our algorithmic processors. It is essential that you place your device at the height indicated in the tutorial for your device. *<em>Please note, different devices have  different height requirements.</em> Please place your device accordingly.

  question: My table is not tall enough to take the photo. What should I do?
  answer: Standard heights for tables and desks range from 28&rdquo; - 30&rdquo;. If your table is not tall enough, place your device on top of a book, a box, a stack of post it notes, or a deck of cards to raise your device to the height indicated. Be sure to use the green check mark at the top left of the screen to confirm the device is level at the new height.

  question: How can I take a picture when I cannot reach my device to press the button?
  answer: SelfieStyler provides two ways to snap your full body selfie. There is a timer button to the left and a large photo button at the center. Use the timer button once your device is placed at the correct height on a table and you can see the green check mark at the top left of the screen indicating that the device is level. Step back about six steps until you are aligned with the red outline. (The top of your head and the tips of your toes will fit into the red outline and your arms and legs should be positioned to also fit into the red outline.) The timer gives you a count of ten to get into position. Alternately, you can ask a friend to press the larger photo button at the center once you are aligned and ready. Smile!

  question: Can my friend take my picture instead?
  answer: While, we all love a little help from our friends, the SelfieStyler full body selfie photo is a hands free process. It is essential that your device is completely still while displaying the green checkmark when your photo is taken. The device must be placed on a table at the height indicated for your device in the tutorial. Your friend can help by letting you know when you are perfectly lined up in the red silhouette. They can even push the big button at the center of the screen to take the photo (instead of using the timer).

  question: How can I make my device stand up so the green checkmark is displayed?
  answer: <ol><li>Be sure to place your device far enough back on the  table that if it falls over, it only falls onto the tabletop and does not fall  to the floor.</li><li>Use something to balance and prop the device. The back  of a laptop screen works well for making small adjustments to the angle. You  can use anything to prop your device that works for you. Here are a few other  prop suggestions: handbag, a canned good like soup, a heavy bottle, a box, a  shoe. Let us know if you found a clever way to &ldquo;make it work&rdquo;.</li><li>If your device falls forward, place a small object in  front of it to steady it, like a deck of cards or a stack of post it notes -  something that will not obscure your view of the screen for the photo.</li></ol>

  question: Why can’t I get myself lined up with the red outline?
  answer: There are a few reasons why you may not be able to align  yourself with your red alignment silhouette:</p><ol><li>Height and Body information provided are not accurate:  measure your height standing against a wall. Stand up straight and do not lean  backwards against the wall. *This may be easier with help from a friend.  Reconfirm your weight and bra size.</li><li>The table height is not the correct height for your  device: stack items on the table to achieve the designated height for your  device.</li><li>Your device is in a phone case: remove your device and  take the photo with it resting directly on the table (or modified surface) that  is at the designated height for your device</li><li>The device is not level: use items like a laptop,  books, box, etc to prop your device until you can see the green level check  mark in the top left corner and the words &ldquo;HOLD&rdquo; just below the photo window.</li><li>You are not barefoot: remove shoes and stand barefoot</li><li>Your table is not on the same floor level where you are  standing for the picture: assure that you stand on the same floor level where  the device has been placed at the designated height.</li><li>You can always ask for help. Please contact us at  MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with perfecting your account  profile.</li></ol>

  question: How do I know which body shape to choose?
  answer:   These body shapes have been around forever. Sometimes they  feel silly or just old fashioned. SelfieStyler uses these tried and true  descriptions to simplify our process and make it more unique to you. Here are  general descriptions for body shapes in order of most to least common:</p><p><em>Rectangle</em> - your  hips and your bust are about the same and your waist is slightly smaller than  than your hips and waist. You do not consider yourself curvy. Your pant size,  shirt size and dress size are often the same size for each of your favorite  brands.</p><p><em>Pear </em>- your bust  and waist are smaller than your hips. You consider yourself curvy when buying  bottoms and jeans. Your shirt size is often a size or two smaller than your  pant size in each of your favorite brands. You may need to have pants and  dresses taken in at the waist.</p><p><em>Apple</em> - your bust,  waist and hip are all about the same size. You consider yourself curvy. Your  pant size, shirt size, and dress size are often the same size for each of your  favorite brands.</p><p><em>Triangle</em> - your  bust is a bit larger than your waist and hips. You consider yourself curvy, or  perhaps even busty, when buying shirts and dresses. You pant size is often a  size or two smaller than your shirt size in each of your favorite brands.</p><p><em>Hourglass</em> - your  hips and your bust are about the same and your waist is smaller than than your  hips and waist. You consider yourself curvy. Your pant size, shirt size and  dress size are often the same size for each of your favorite brands, but you  may need to have pants and dresses taken in at the waist.

  question: I think I am lined up with the red outline for my photo, but I cannot tell for sure. What can I do?
  answer:   This is when it may help to have a friend look at the screen  more closely to tell you when you are aligned. They can press the photo button  at the center or activate the timer to let the app snap your photo. If you are  taking the photo solo, line up the best you can. On the next screen, with the  silhouette marker, you will be able to confirm if you were within the outline  area. Look for the following:</p><ol><li>If the outline is just above your hairline at the top  of your skull and outlines most of the tips of your toes at the bottom, you are  perfect!</li><li>If the outline is below your hairline and above your  toes, retake the photo and move a little further away from the device.</li><li>If the outline is above head and below your toes,  retake the photo and move a little closer to the device.</li><li>If the outline is mostly above your head and your toes  fit fine, check the table height and confirm the device indicates it is level  by showing the green check mark and the words &ldquo;HOLD&rdquo; just below the photo  window.</li><li>If the outline is mostly below your toes and your head  fits fine, check the table height and confirm the device indicates it is level  by showing the green check mark and the word &ldquo;HOLD&rdquo; just below the photo  window.</li><li>You can always ask for help.

  question: I took my full height selfie, but the outline on the silhouette marker screen does not align with my body.
  answer: <p>A little variation is normal, but you should mostly be close  to edge of the lines - especially for your total height. <em>*Note that hairstyles can add height to your image. The outline should  align with the crown of your head as if your hair was pulled back into a tight  bun.</em> If the height of the mask is much taller or shorter than your image  please review descriptions below to correct your image:</p><ol><li>If the outline is just above your hairline at the top  of your skull and outlines most of the tips of your toes at the bottom, you are  perfect!</li><li>If the outline is below your hairline and above your  toes, retake the photo and move a little further back.</li><li>If the outline is above head and below your toes,  retake the photo and move a little further forward.</li><li>If the outline is mostly above your head and your toes  fit fine, check the table height and confirm the device indicates it is level  by showing the green check mark and the words &ldquo;HOLD&rdquo; just below the photo  window.</li><li>If the outline is mostly below your toes and your head  fits fine, check the table height and confirm the device indicates it is level  by showing the green check mark and the word &ldquo;HOLD&rdquo; just below the photo  window.</li><li>If the outline is the right height, but the silhouette  shaping does not align with your body: confirm your weight, bra size, and body  shape. Go to the main menu at the left and select Measurement. You can update  your details here. Be sure to click SAVE. Then select &ldquo;Edit Full Height Selfie&rdquo;  from the main menu at the left. Click the reset button. The silhouette thing  should be more closely aligned with your image now. Adjust the silhouette  marker points to customize your fit.</li><li>You can always ask for help.

  question: The measurements listed for me on the Measurement page are close, but not exactly my measurements. What can I do?
  answer: If three professional tailors measured you right now, they would all come up with slightly different measurements for you. Your unique shape is more than just the sum of your bust, waist and hips. SelfieStyler’s proprietary technology analyzes your unique shape from head to toe. We have a systematic process that identifies your fit points to achieve the most accurate results with our algorithms. Generally, if your measurements are close, it is best to keep the assigned dimensions. It is possible to override the system measurements from the measurements link in the main menu. New values that are added will overwrite the system measurements. Any edited values will be overwritten by the system the next time you adjust and save your silhouette marker. We are here to help. lease contact us at MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with perfecting your account profile.

  question: The measurements listed for me on the Measurement page are not my measurements at all. What can I do?
  answer: <p>It is likely there was a problem when you uploaded your  Selfie image or set and saved your silhouette marker. You may need to try  taking the photo again. Please review the tutorial and the &ldquo;how it works&rdquo;  directions. You can also review these FAQ&rsquo;s:</p><p><em><u>Why can&rsquo;t I get  myself lined up with the red outline?</u></em> (hyper link to this question if  possible)</p><p><em>I took my full height  selfie, but the outline on the silhouette marker screen does not align with my  body. </em>(hyper link to this question if possible)</p><p>We are here to help.

  question: What exactly is the Fitting Alert and the Fit Index all about?
  answer: <p>The Fit Index is a number that captures how well each size  in a any style fits your unique shape. The range is from 0 to 10 with a 10  being the perfect fit. So what exactly is a perfect fit? A perfect fit would  mean that the garment fits like it was custom made to your exact measurements.  A Fit Index of 8 or more generally indicates a great fit for you. Lower Fit  index numbers suggest that there may be some fit compromises in this style.  Expect some of the fit points to fit exactly while others may be a close  fitting or a little loose. This is normal.</p><p>When we try clothes on in the fitting room we have to find  items that we 1. fit into and 2. that flatter us. The Fit Index takes care of  1 - fitting into items by only only providing a Fit Index value for clothes  that are a possible fit. If a particular size in an item is listed as too small  and your Fit Index is 0,  it is most  likely too tight to wear. Likewise, if a particular size in an item is listed  as too loose and the Fit Index is 0, it is most likely this items is a few  sizes too big and might even fall off of you. </p><p>The Fit Index suggested the most flattering size for you  based on the your dimension and how it relates to styling profile of each  designer/manufacturer. Items with the highest Fit Index are most likely to be  the most flattering. Items with lower Fit Indexes can still be appealing, but  note the specific advice in the Fitting Alert to understand how some of the  ways this garment fits you, may not be the most ideal fit for you. Since beauty  is in the eye of the beholder, keep in mind that you should follow your  personal preferences. If the Fit Index says your best size is &ldquo;close fitting&rdquo;  in the waist and you know that you dislike anything that fits too tightly in  the waist, look to the next larger size to see if it is a perfect fit in the  waist. </p><p>You can always ask for help. Please contact us at  MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with choosing the best size for  you.

  question: Why can I see my clothes in my selfie photo while trying on clothes in the fitting room?
  answer: At SelfieStyler we work with what your are comfortable with. The less clothing visible in your selfie, the less interference you will have with clothing from your selfie in the fitting room. Anything that would not be covered trying clothes on in real life will also show up in our fitting room if you wear it in your selfie photo. A nude strapless bra and underwear is ideal.

  question: Why do I see some of my arm or legs, behind the clothing?
  answer: With SelfieStyler, your styled looks are built on your body. We like to keep it real. In some cases, your posture may cause a little bit of an arm or leg to show. No worries, if the fitting alert indicates you have a good fit in this area, trust the alert. We are working to enhance these functions for more true-to-life effects!

  question: Why are some clothes too high or too low only on one side of my shoulder? It looks right on the other side.
  answer: While we consider our bodies to be symmetrical, your left and right side are not mirror images. Your posture is unique and means that you will shift your weight a little more to one side. We take an average of your shoulders to determine how you wear your shirts. In some cases, this may mean that our clothing fits one shoulder but not the other in your selfie image. Rest assured, in real life the clothing will fit just fine.

  question: My clothes arrived. They fit okay, but I like my clothes a bit tighter (or a bit looser). How can I get the best fit for my style on SelfieStyler?
  answer: <p>Style is so much more than just the clothes you wear. It is  how you put it all together. Our algorithms are tuned to ensure that all of our  members find a great fit every time you shop with us. We are continually  working to personalize SelfieStyler to accurately reflect your style. Rest  assured, we are incorporating your feedback into our algorithms. </p><p>SelfieStyler recommends the best size for you in each style  based on general fitting guidelines. You are free to order any size you like.  Think about how the clothes in your closet currently fit. Do you wear baggy  jeans, or skin tight jeans? Are your favorite shirts loose and oversized or  snug? If most of your tops fit closely through the bust then you may prefer  items on SelfieStyler with the alert &ldquo;close fitting&rdquo; over items with the  &ldquo;perfect fit&rdquo; alert. If you love a relaxed look and all your tops are roomy,  you may prefer items with the alert &ldquo;loose&rdquo; or even &ldquo;extra loose&rdquo;. Note that  items with the alert &ldquo;too small&rdquo; will generally be too small to wear.

  answer: At SelfieStyler, we love this question! It is not you, it is  the system. You are perfect, but designers and manufacturers all play by  different rules when it comes to setting sizes. This leads to chaos in the  fitting room. Sometimes we even wear different sizes of the same brand. Rest  assured, with SelfieStyler, this is the last thing <em>you </em>need to worry about. We have taken all the guesswork out of  finding your best size. Our algorithms fit your unique shape into every size of  every style you try. Start with our recommended size in every style. Then, if  you prefer, you can see if you can shift a size down for a closer fit, or a  size up for a looser fit.

  question: If I lose or gain weight do I need to update my selfie image?
  answer: We have all been there, that moment when you know your  clothes no longer work and it is time to shop. Suddenly all your tried and true  brands and sizes mean nothing. SelfieStyler makes this easy. We will fit the  new you into a whole new wardrobe. We all gain and lose weight throughout the  day every day. It is normal to add an inch or so to your waist over a meal. As  long as you have not noticed a big difference in the way the clothes in your  closet fit, you can keep your Selfie image. When you find your pants and skirts  will not stay up, or you struggle to button and zip clothes closed, you need to  replace your Selfie image.
