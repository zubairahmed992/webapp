  question: My table is not tall enough to take the photo. What should I do?
  answer: Standard heights for tables and desks range from 28” - 30”. If your table is not tall enough, place your device on top of a book, a box, a stack of post it notes, or a deck of cards to raise your device to the height indicated. Be sure to use the green check mark at the top left of the screen to confirm the device is level at the new height.

  question: How can I take a picture when I cannot reach my device to press the button?
  answer: SelfieStyler provides two ways to snap your full body selfie. There is a timer button to the left and a large photo button at the center. Use the timer button once your device is placed at the correct height on a table and you can see the green check mark at the top left of the screen indicating that the device is level. Step back about six steps until you are aligned with the red outline. (The top of your head and the tips of your toes will fit into the red outline and your arms and legs should be positioned to also fit into the red outline.) The timer gives you a count of ten to get into position. Alternately, you can ask a friend to press the larger photo button at the center once you are aligned and ready. Smile!

  question: Can my friend take my picture instead?
  answer: While, we all love a little help from our friends, the SelfieStyler full body selfie photo is a hands free process. It is essential that your device is completely still while displaying the green checkmark when your photo is taken. The device must be placed on a table at the height indicated for your device in the tutorial. Your friend can help by letting you know when you are perfectly lined up in the red silhouette. They can even push the big button at the center of the screen to take the photo (instead of using the timer).

  question: How can I make my device stand up so the green checkmark is displayed?
  answer: "1.Be sure to place your device far enough back on the table that if it falls over, it only falls onto the tabletop and does not fall to the floor. 2.	Use something to balance and prop the device. The back of a laptop screen works well for making small adjustments to the angle. You can use anything to prop your device that works for you. Here are a few other prop suggestions- handbag, a canned good like soup, a heavy bottle, a box, a shoe. Let us know if you found a clever way to make it work. 3. If your device falls forward, place a small object in front of it to steady it, like a deck of cards or a stack of post it notes-something that will not obscure your view of the screen for the photo."

  question: Why can’t I get myself lined up with the red outline?
  answer: "There are a few reasons why you may not be able to align yourself with your red alignment silhouette- 1.Height and Body information provided are not accurate: measure your height standing against a wall. Stand up straight and do not lean backwards against the wall. *This may be easier with help from a friend. Reconfirm your weight and bra size. 2.	The table height is not the correct height for your device: stack items on the table to achieve the designated height for your device. 3. Your device is in a phone case: remove your device and take the photo with it resting directly on the table (or modified surface) that is at the designated height for your device 4.The device is not level: use items like a laptop, books, box, etc to prop your device until you can see the green level check mark in the top left corner and the words “HOLD” just below the photo window. 5.	You are not barefoot: remove shoes and stand barefoot 6.	Your table is not on the same floor level where you are standing for the picture: assure that you stand on the same floor level where the device has been placed at the designated height. 7.	You can always ask for help. Please contact us at MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with perfecting your account profile."

  question: How do I know which body shape to choose?
  answer: "These body shapes have been around forever. Sometimes they feel silly or just old fashioned.

Here are general descriptions for body shapes in order of most to least common: Rectangle - your hips and your bust are about the same and your waist is slightly smaller than than your hips and waist. You do not consider yourself curvy. Your pant size, shirt size and dress size are often the same size for each of your favorite brands.Pear - your bust and waist are smaller than your hips. You consider yourself curvy when buying bottoms and jeans. Your shirt size is often a size or two smaller than your pant size in each of your favorite brands. You may need to have pants and dresses taken in at the waist.Apple - your bust, waist and hip are all about the same size. You consider yourself curvy. Your pant size, shirt size, and dress size are often the same size for each of your favorite brands.Triangle - your bust is a bit larger than your waist and hips. You consider yourself curvy, or perhaps even busty, when buying shirts and dresses. You pant size is often a size or two smaller than your shirt size in each of your favorite brands.Hourglass - your hips and your bust are about the same and your waist is smaller than than your hips and waist. You consider yourself curvy. Your pant size, shirt size and dress size are often the same size for each of your favorite brands, but you may need to have pants and dresses taken in at the waist."

  question: I think I am lined up with the red outline for my photo, but I cannot tell for sure. What can I do?
  answer: "This is when it may help to have a friend look at the screen more closely to tell you when you are aligned. They can press the photo button at the center or activate the timer to let the app snap your photo. If you are taking the photo solo, line up the best you can. On the next screen, with the silhouette marker, you will be able to confirm if you were within the outline area. Look for the following: 1.	If the outline is just above your hairline at the top of your skull and outlines most of the tips of your toes at the bottom, you are perfect! 2.	If the outline is below your hairline and above your toes, retake the photo and move a little further away from the device. 3.	If the outline is above head and below your toes, retake the photo and move a little closer to the device. 4.	If the outline is mostly above your head and your toes fit fine, check the table height and confirm the device indicates it is level by showing the green check mark and the words “HOLD” just below the photo window. 5.	If the outline is mostly below your toes and your head fits fine, check the table height and confirm the device indicates it is level by showing the green check mark and the word “HOLD” just below the photo window. 6.	You can always ask for help. Please contact us at MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with perfecting your account profile."

  question: I took my full height selfie, but the outline on the silhouette marker screen does not align with my body.
  answer: "A little variation is normal, but you should mostly be close to edge of the lines - especially for your total height. *Note that hairstyles can add height to your image. The outline should align with the crown of your head as if your hair was pulled back into a tight bun. If the height of the mask is much taller or shorter than your image please review descriptions below to correct your image: 1.	If the outline is just above your hairline at the top of your skull and outlines most of the tips of your toes at the bottom, you are perfect! 2.	If the outline is below your hairline and above your toes, retake the photo and move a little further back. 3.	If the outline is above head and below your toes, retake the photo and move a little further forward. 4.	If the outline is mostly above your head and your toes fit fine, check the table height and confirm the device indicates it is level by showing the green check mark and the words “HOLD” just below the photo window. 5.	If the outline is mostly below your toes and your head fits fine, check the table height and confirm the device indicates it is level by showing the green check mark and the word “HOLD” just below the photo window. 6.	If the outline is the right height, but the silhouette shaping does not align with your body: confirm your weight, bra size, and body shape. Go to the main menu at the left and select Measurement. You can update your details here. Be sure to click SAVE. Then select “Edit Full Height Selfie” from the main menu at the left. Click the reset button. The silhouette thing should be more closely aligned with your image now. Adjust the silhouette marker points to customize your fit. 7.	You can always ask for help. Please contact us at MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with perfecting your account profile."

  question: The measurements listed for me on the Measurement page are close, but not exactly my measurements. What can I do?
  answer: If three professional tailors measured you right now, they would all come up with slightly different measurements for you. Your unique shape is more than just the sum of your bust, waist and hips. SelfieStyler’s proprietary technology analyzes your unique shape from head to toe. We have a systematic process that identifies your fit points to achieve the most accurate results with our algorithms. Generally, if your measurements are close, it is best to keep the assigned dimensions. It is possible to override the system measurements from the measurements link in the main menu. New values that are added will overwrite the system measurements. Any edited values will be overwritten by the system the next time you adjust and save your silhouette marker. We are here to help. lease contact us at MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with perfecting your account profile.

  question: What exactly is the Fitting Alert and the Fit Index all about?
  answer: The Fit Index is a number that captures how well each size in a any style fits your unique shape. The range is from 0 to 10 with a 10 being the perfect fit. So what exactly is a perfect fit? A perfect fit would mean that the garment fits like it was custom made to your exact measurements. A Fit Index of 8 or more generally indicates a great fit for you. Lower Fit index numbers suggest that there may be some fit compromises in this style. Expect some of the fit points to fit exactly while others may be a close fitting or a little loose. This is normal. When we try clothes on in the fitting room we have to find items that we 1. fit into and 2. that flatter us. The Fit Index takes care of #1 - fitting into items by only only providing a Fit Index value for clothes that are a possible fit. If a particular size in an item is listed as too small and your Fit Index is 0,  it is most likely too tight to wear. Likewise, if a particular size in an item is listed as too loose and the Fit Index is 0, it is most likely this items is a few sizes too big and might even fall off of you. The Fit Index suggested the most flattering size for you based on the your dimension and how it relates to styling profile of each designer/manufacturer. Items with the highest Fit Index are most likely to be the most flattering. Items with lower Fit Indexes can still be appealing, but note the specific advice in the Fitting Alert to understand how some of the ways this garment fits you, may not be the most ideal fit for you. Since beauty is in the eye of the beholder, keep in mind that you should follow your personal preferences. If the Fit Index says your best size is “close fitting” in the waist and you know that you dislike anything that fits too tightly in the waist, look to the next larger size to see if it is a perfect fit in the waist. You can always ask for help. Please contact us at MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with choosing the best size for you.
