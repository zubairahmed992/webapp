  question: Do I really need to use the Selfie Photo Stand to take my picture?
  answer: SelfieStyler’s selfie is more than just a pretty picture. Our selfie process scans your unique silhouette into our database for our algorithmic processors. It is essential that you place your device in the Selfie Photo Stand as indicated in the tutorial.

  question: How can I take a picture when I cannot reach my device to press the button?
  answer: SelfieStyler provides two ways to snap your selfie. There is a timer button to the left and a large photo button at the center. Use the timer button once your device is placed in the Selfie Photo Stand and you can see the green check mark at the top left of the screen indicating that the device is level. Step back about six steps until you are aligned with the red outline. (The top of your head and the tips of your toes will fit into the red outline and your arms and legs should be positioned to also fit into the red outline.) The timer gives you a count of ten to get into position. Alternately, you can ask a friend to press the larger photo button at the center once you are aligned and ready. Smile!

  question: Can my friend take my picture instead?
  answer: While we all love a little help from our friends, the SelfieStyler selfie photo is a hands free process. It is essential that your device is completely still while displaying the green checkmark when your photo is taken. The device must be placed in the Selfie Photo Stand as shown in the tutorial. Your friend can help by letting you know when you are perfectly lined up in the red silhouette. They can even push the big button at the center of the screen to take the photo (instead of using the timer).

  question: Why can’t I get myself lined up with the red outline?
  answer: There are a few reasons why you may not be able to align yourself with your red alignment silhouette:</p><ol><li>1. Height and Body information provided are not accurate: measure your height standing against a wall. Stand up straight and do not lean backwards against the wall. *This may be easier with help from a friend. Reconfirm your weight and bra size.</li><li>Your device is in a phone case: remove your device and take the photo with it inserted into the Selfie Photo Stand.</li><li>The device is not level: make sure there are no objects between the bottom of the stand and the floor. Check to make sure your Selfie Photo Stand photo stand is placed on a flat area of floor and that you are standing on the same flooring surface. If you are still having trouble try moving your stand to a hard flooring surface like hardwood, laminate, tile, etc. <em>*High pile carpeting may disrupt the stand<em></li><li>You are not barefoot: remove shoes and stand barefoot</li><li>You can always ask for help. Please contact us at MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with perfecting your account profile.</li></ol>

  question: How do I know which body shape to choose?
  answer:   These body shapes have been around forever. Sometimes they feel silly or just old fashioned. SelfieStyler uses these tried and true descriptions to simplify our process and make it more unique to you. Here are general descriptions for body shapes in order of most to least common:</p><p><em>Rectangle</em> - your hips and your bust are about the same and your waist is slightly smaller than than your hips and waist. You do not consider yourself curvy. Your pant size, shirt size and dress size are often the same size for each of your favorite brands.</p><p><em>Pear </em>- your bust and waist are smaller than your hips. You consider yourself curvy when buying bottoms and jeans. Your shirt size is often a size or two smaller than your pant size in each of your favorite brands. You may need to have pants and dresses taken in at the waist.</p><p><em>Apple</em> - your bust, waist and hip are all about the same size. You consider yourself curvy. Your pant size, shirt size, and dress size are often the same size for each of your favorite brands.</p><p><em>Triangle</em> - your bust is a bit larger than your waist and hips. You consider yourself curvy, or perhaps even busty, when buying shirts and dresses. Your pant size is often a size or two smaller than your shirt size in each of your favorite brands.</p><p><em>Hourglass</em> - your hips and your bust are about the same and your waist is smaller than than your hips and waist. You consider yourself curvy. Your pant size, shirt size and dress size are often the same size for each of your favorite brands, but you may need to have pants and dresses taken in at the waist.

  question: I think I am lined up with the red outline for my photo, but I cannot tell for sure. What can I do?
  answer:   This is when it may help to have a friend look at the screen more closely to tell you when you are aligned. They can press the photo button at the center or activate the timer to let the app snap your photo. If you are taking the photo solo, line up the best you can. On the next screen, with the silhouette marker, you will be able to confirm if you were within the outline area. Look for the following:</p><ol><li>1.  If the outline is just above your hairline at the top of your skull and outlines most of the tips of your toes at the bottom, you are perfect!</li><li>2. If the outline is below your hairline and above your toes, retake the photo and move a little further away from the device.</li><li>If the outline is above head and below your toes, retake the photo and move a little closer to the device.</li><li>4. If the outline is mostly above your head and your toes fit fine,check the Selfie Photo Stand to confirm it is level on the floor and that the app is showing the green check mark and the words &ldquo;HOLD&rdquo; just below the photo window.</li><li>5.  If the outline is mostly below your toes and your head fits fine,check the Selfie Photo Stand to and confirm it is level on the floor and the app is showing the green check mark and the word &ldquo;HOLD&rdquo; just below the photo  window.</li><li>You can always ask for help.

  question: I took my selfie, but the outline on the silhouette screen does not align with my body?
  answer: A little variation is normal, but you should mostly be close to edge of the lines - especially for your total height<em>*Note that hairstyles can add height to your image. The outline should align with the crown of your head as if your hair was pulled back into a tight bun.</em>If the height of the mask is much taller or shorter than your image please review descriptions below to correct your image:<ol><li>If the outline is just above your hairline at the top of your skull and outlines most of the tips of your toes at the bottom, you are perfect!</li><li>If the outline is below your hairline and above your toes, retake the photo and move a little further back.</li><li>If the outline is above head and below your toes, retake the photo and move a little further forward.</li><li>If the outline is mostly above your head and your toes fit fine, check the Selfie Photo Stand to confirm it is level on the floor and that the app is showing the green check mark and the words &ldquo;HOLD&rdquo; just below the photo window.</li><li>If the outline is mostly below your toes and your head fits fine, check the Selfie Photo Stand to confirm it is level on the floor and that the app is showing the green check mark and the words &ldquo;HOLD&rdquo; just below the photo window.</li><li>You can always ask for help.

  question: The measurements listed for me on the Measurement page are close, but not exactly my measurements. What can I do?
  answer: <p>If three professional tailors measured you right now, they would all come up with slightly different measurements for you. Your unique shape is more than just the sum of your bust, waist and hips. SelfieStyler’s proprietary technology analyzes your unique shape from head to toe. We have a systematic process that identifies your fit points to achieve the most accurate results with our algorithms. Generally, if your measurements are close, it is best to keep the assigned dimensions. It is possible to override the system measurements from the measurements link in the main menu. New values that are added will overwrite the system measurements. Any edited values will be overwritten by the system the next time you adjust and save your silhouette marker. We are here to help.

  question: The measurements listed for me on the Measurement page are not my measurements at all. What can I do?
  answer: <p>How long has it been since you took your selfie? If it has been some time and your size has changed, take a new selfie to confirm your measurements. If you have recently uploaded your image please keep in mind that even trained professionals measure differently and that slight variations are normal. If you have noticed a large difference in your measurements please contact us at MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with perfecting your account profile. You can also review the tutorial and the “how it works” directions. You can also review these FAQ&rsquo;s:</p><p><em><u>Why can&rsquo;t I get myself lined up with the red outline?</u></em> (hyper link to this question if  possible)</p><p><em>I took my full height  selfie, but the outline on the silhouette marker screen does not align with my  body.</em></p><p><em><u>I took my selfie, but the outline on the silhouette marker screen does not align with my body.</u></em></p><p>We are here to help.

  question: What exactly is the Fitting Alert and the Fit Index all about?
  answer: <p>The Fit Index is a number that captures how well each size in any style fits your unique shape. The range is from 0 to 10 with a 10 being the perfect fit. So what exactly is a perfect fit? A perfect fit would mean that the garment fits like it was custom made to your exact measurements. A Fit Index of 8 or more generally indicates a great fit for you. Lower Fit index numbers suggest that there may be some fit compromises in this style. Expect some of the fit points to fit exactly while others may be a close fitting or a little loose. This is normal.</p><pWhen we try clothes on in the fitting room we have to find items that we 1. fit into and 2. that flatter us. The Fit Index takes care of 1 - fitting into items by only only providing a Fit Index value for clothes that are a possible fit. If a particular size in an item is listed as too small and your Fit Index is 0,  it is most likely too tight to wear. Likewise, if a particular size in an item is listed as too loose and the Fit Index is 0, it is most likely this items is a few sizes too big and might even fall off of you.</p><p>The Fit Index suggested the most flattering size for you based on your dimension and how it relates to the styling profile of each designer/manufacturer. Items with the highest Fit Index are most likely to be the most flattering. Items with lower Fit Indexes can still be appealing, but note the specific advice in the Fitting Alert to understand how some of the ways this garment fits you may not be the most ideal fit for you. Since beauty is in the eye of the beholder, keep in mind that you should follow your personal preferences. If the Fit Index says your best size is “close fitting” in the waist and you know that you dislike anything that fits too tightly in the waist, look to the next larger size to see if it is a perfect fit in the waist.</p><p>You can always ask for help. Please contact us at MemberSupport@SelfieStyler.com for assistance with choosing the best size for you.</p>

  question: Why can I see my clothes in my selfie photo while trying on clothes in the fitting room?
  answer: At SelfieStyler we work with what your are comfortable with. The less clothing visible in your selfie, the less interference you will have with clothing from your selfie in the fitting room. Anything that would not be covered trying clothes on in real life will also show up in our fitting room if you wear it in your selfie photo. A nude strapless bra and underwear is ideal.

  question: Why do I see some of my arm or legs behind the clothing?
  answer: With SelfieStyler, your styled looks are built on your body. We like to keep it real. In some cases, your posture may cause a little bit of an arm or leg to show. No worries, if the fitting alert indicates you have a good fit in this area, trust the alert. We are working to enhance these functions for more true-to-life effects!

  question: Why are some clothes too high or too low only on one side of my shoulder? It looks right on the other side.
  answer: While we consider our bodies to be symmetrical, your left and right side are not mirror images. Your posture is unique and means that you will shift your weight a little more to one side. We take an average of your shoulders to determine how you wear your shirts. In some cases, this may mean that our clothing fits one shoulder but not the other in your selfie image. Rest assured, in real life the clothing will fit just fine.

  question: My clothes arrived. They fit okay, but I like my clothes a bit tighter (or a bit looser). How can I get the best fit for my style on SelfieStyler?
  answer: <p>Style is so much more than just the clothes you wear. It is how you put it all together. Our algorithms are tuned to ensure that all of our members find a great fit every time you shop with us. We are continually working to personalize SelfieStyler to accurately reflect your style. Rest assured, we are incorporating your feedback into our algorithms.</p><p>SelfieStyler recommends the best size for you in each style based on general fitting guidelines. You are free to order any size you like. Think about how the clothes in your closet currently fit. Do you wear baggy jeans, or skin tight jeans? Are your favorite shirts loose and oversized or snug? If most of your tops fit closely through the bust then you may prefer items on SelfieStyler with the alert &ldquo;close fitting&rdquo; over items with the &ldquo;perfect fit&rdquo; alert. If you love a relaxed look and all your tops are roomy, you may prefer items with the alert &ldquo;loose&rdquo; or even &ldquo;extra loose&rdquo;. Note that  items with the alert &ldquo;too small&rdquo; will generally be too small to wear.

  question: Why am I a size 2 in one brand and a size 6 in another?
  answer: At SelfieStyler, we love this question! It is not you, it is the system. You are perfect, but designers and manufacturers all play by different rules when it comes to setting sizes. This leads to chaos in the fitting room. Sometimes we even wear different sizes of the same brand. Rest assured, with SelfieStyler, this is the last thing <em>you </em>need to worry about. We have taken all the guesswork out of finding your best size. Our algorithms fit your unique shape into every size of every style you try. Start with our recommended size in every style. Then, if you prefer, see if you can shift a size down for a closer fit, or a size up for a looser fit.

  question: If I lose or gain weight do I need to update my selfie image?
  answer: We have all been there, that moment when you know your clothes no longer work and it is time to shop. Suddenly all your tried and true brands and sizes mean nothing. SelfieStyler makes this easy. We will fit the new you into a whole new wardrobe. We all gain and lose weight throughout the day every day. It is normal to add an inch or so to your waist over a meal. As long as you have not noticed a big difference in the way the clothes in your closet fit, you can keep your Selfie image. When you find your pants and skirts will not stay up, or you struggle to button and zip clothes closed, you need to replace your Selfie image.
